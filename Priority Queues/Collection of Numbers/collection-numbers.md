# Program for Maintaining a Collection of Integers

This program is designed to maintain a collection of integers and perform various operations on them.

## Operations

- `S x`: Store a copy of the given number `x`.
- `K`: Print the maximum number.
- `R`: Remove the maximum number (one occurrence, if repeated).
- `I x`: Increase the maximum number (one occurrence, if repeated) by `x` units.
- `D x`: Decrease the maximum number (one occurrence, if repeated) by `x` units.

Please note that the operations assume the presence of a collection of integers and operate on the maximum number in the collection (one occurrence, if repeated).
