# Palindrome with Stacks 

Use a stack to determine, for an integer n and a sequence of
given integers of length n, whether the sequence is a palindrome or not. That is, it must
indicate whether the sequence reads the same from left to right as it does from left to right (without
reverse the digits within each integer)

## Input
The input consists of an integer n and a sequence of
integers of length n.

## Output
It is necessary to write "YES" or "NO" as appropriate.
